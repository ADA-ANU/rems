# How to contribute

REMS is an open source project and we are open to issues and pull requests from everyone. Before starting on working something big/non-trivial, please submit an issue first, we can help with the design and provide assistance!

[development.md](development.md) contains some instructions on how to get started.

See [https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/labels/Good%20First%20Issue](Good first issue) and [https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/labels/Help%20Wanted](Help wanted).

## Submitting a pull request

To work on an issue do the following:

- Fork the repository in Github
- Clone your repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/rems.git
```
- Make sure that tests pass by running `lein alltests`
- Submit a pull request against the main repository
- Fill in the info you think is relevant for the PR (screenshots, tests, ...)
- Wait for the CI build to finish and fix the findings
- One of the core team members will review it
- React to questions and comments in the PR
- Let's get it merged and celebrate!
