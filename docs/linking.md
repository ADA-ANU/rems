#Linking to REMS

REMS supports linking users directly to application forms, pre-existing applications etc. Unauthenticated users will be redirected to a login page before being sent to the desired url. Below are listed a couple of examples on how the linking works.

## Linking into catalogue

```
https://rems2demo.csc.fi/#/catalogue
```

## Linking into a new application

This application has items with catalogue item ids 2 and 3.

```
https://rems2demo.csc.fi/#/application?items=2,3
```

## Linking into an existing application

```
https://rems2demo.csc.fi/#/application/2
```
